.Sh NAME
.Nm flowgen
.Nd generate various NetFlow V5 packets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar flowrec-options
.Ar collector
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates NetFlow V5 packets in various ways. This tool is intended to be used when
you want to test software/hardware that receives NetFlow V5 packets (e.g. NetFlow
Collector).
.Pp
.Ar collector
is an IPv4 address to which this software send NetFlow packets.
.Pp
There are two types of options you can specify. One is
.Ar options ,
and another is
.Ar flowrec-options .
In general,
.Ar options
controls how NetFlow V5 packets are generated, whereas
.Ar flowrec-options
controls how each flow record is populated in the NetFlow packet.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "1234567890123" -compact
.It Fl n Ar count
.It Fl Fl count Ar count
specifies the number of flow records to be generated. By default, it is 0 which means
"infinite" times.
.Pp
.It Fl p Ar port
.It Fl Fl port Ar port
specifies the destination port number that will be used for NetFlow packets. By
default, it is 2055.
.Pp
.It Fl V Ar n
.It Fl Fl version Ar n
specifies the version number of NetFlow. This option is for future use.
It is currently hard coded to 5.
.Pp
.It Fl f Ar number
.It Fl Fl flowrec Ar number
specifies the number of flow records which are filled into the NetFlow packet.
By default, it is 30, the maximum number in NetFlow V5.
.Pp
.It Fl d Ar level
.It Fl Fl debug Ar level
specifies the debug level. The greater of this level, the more verbose output will
be displayed. Default is 0, which disables the debug mode.
.Pp
.It Fl N
.It Fl Fl nosend
When this flag is specified, no NetFlow packets will be generated.
.Pp
.It Fl h
.It Fl Fl help
displays help message.
.Pp
.El
.Sh FLOW RECORD OPTIONS
.Ar flowrec-options
control how flow records are populated in NetFlow packet. Most options
have a corresponding field in the NetFlow flow record. Exceptions are
.Cm enginetype
and
.Cm engineid
options. In fact these two parameters appear in a NetFlow header, not in a flow
record. However, let's regard these two options a
.Ar flowrec-options
because they share one important property with other
.Ar flowrec-options
described in the following paragraph.
.Pp
All
.Ar flowrec-options
take a parameter as an
.Ar expression.
This
.Ar expression
is evaluated every time a flow record is populated (for
.Cm enginetype
and
.Cm engineid
options, every time a NetFlow packet is generated.
.Pp
.Ar expression
is a number that may change every time it is evaluated. There are four
types of expressions; Sequential, Random, Probabilistic, and Static.
.Pp
Sequential expression
is expressed using the meta character '-'. For example, the expression
'10-20' is evaluated as 10, 11, ... 20 and then wraps around to 10.
Please note that start number and end number are specified as "inclusive".
.Pp
Random expression is expressed using the meta character ':'. For example,
'10:20' is evaluated to the number ranging from 10 to 20 randomly. Each
number has the same probability of occurrence. Start and end number are
specified as "inclusive".
.Pp
Probabilistic expression generates a certain number with a specified probability.
For example, the expression "100@70,200@20,300@10" is evaluated to one of
100, 200, or 300 with
the probability of 70%, 20%, 10% respectively. It is a user's responsibility
to specify the probability that add up to 100% altogether. You can enumerate
any number of "number@probability" pairs concatenated by ','.
.Pp
Static expression doesn't include any meta characters such as '-', ':', '@'
and ','. The expression is always evaluated to the value itself and doesn't
change forever.
.Pp
The usage of expression is not limited to denote a simple value parameter. It can
also be used to express IPv4 address. For example, "192.168.0.1-254" will
be evaluated to the IPv4 address whose first three octets are "192.168.0" and
the 4th octet ranging from 1 to 254 sequentially.

.Bl -tag -width "1234567890123" -compact
.It Fl w Ar msec
.It Fl Fl wait Ar msec
specifies the duration of pause (wait) that will be placed at each
flow record generation. It is specified in millisecond (ms).
The default of this option is the expression "0", which means
that flow records will be generated at a maximum speed.
This option can be used in conjunction with
.Cm interval
option to get a sub-millisecond wait duration effectively.
.Pp
.It Fl i Ar num
.It Fl Fl interval Ar num
specifies the number of interval between two pauses that will be placed.
For example, if
.Cm wait
is specified as 1 and
.Cm interval
is specified as 100, then 1 millisecond pause will be placed in every 100
flow records. The default is the expression "1", which means that the pause
specified by
.Cm wait
option will be placed in every flow record generation.
.Pp
.It Fl Fl srcaddr Ar ip-address
is a source IPv4 address field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"10.0.0.1:254".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl dstaddr Ar ip-address
is a destination IPv4 address field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"20.0.0.1:254".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl nexthop Ar ip-address
is a IPv4 nexthop address field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"30.0.0.254".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl inputif Ar ifindex
is an IfIndex number of the input (i.e. ingress) interface field in a flow record.
The default is the expression "1".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl outputif Ar ifindex
is an IfIndex number of the output (i.e. egress) interface field in a flow record.
The default is the expression "2".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl packets Ar num
is a number of packets field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"10:1000".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl octets Ar num
is a number of octets field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"300:300000".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl firstseen Ar msec
represents how long ago (in milli-second) the first flow packet was observed
since the last flow was observed. The default value is the expression "10:1000".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl lastseen Ar msec
represents how long ago (in milli-second) the last flow packet was observed
since the time of flow record generation. The default value is the expression "0",
which means "the last flow was seen at the very instant of flow record generation".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl srcport Ar num
is a source port number field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"1001-2000".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl dstport Ar num
is a destination port number field in a flow record. The default is the expression
"3001-4000".
.Pp
.It Fl Fl tcpflags Ar num
is a TCP flags field in a flow record. The default is the expression "27", which
represents the cumulative OR of ACK, PSH, SYN, and FIN.
.Pp
.It Fl Fl protocol Ar num
is a protocol field in a flow record. The default is the expression "6", which
represents TCP.
.Pp
.It Fl Fl tos Ar num
is a ToS field in a flow record. The default is the expression "0".
